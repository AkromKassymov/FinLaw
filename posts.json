      "<h1>Options for Employee Profit Sharing and Equity</h1> <h2>1. Profit Sharing Without Equity</h2><p>The first option is to recognize that there are potentially negative tax implications if you give your employee equity and to not grant them any equity at all. You could instead have an employment agreement to provide the employee with a percentage of the net profits from your business as a bonus. The employee would still get the benefit of getting a percentage of the net profits without having to go out of pocket to purchase their equity or potentially having to recognize as taxable income the fair market value of the equity.</p><p>A drawback to this approach is psychologically people are often motivated more when they own equity in a company than with a profit-sharing plan, even if the net take-home is the same. There is something innately appealing to owning a piece of the company that you work for.</p><h2>2. Grant Equity</h2><p>If you grant your employee equity, the employee might have to recognize as taxable income the fair market value of that equity just as if you had given the employee a car, a house, or anything else of value. One example of this concept is if you were to get a World Series ring for working for a Major League Baseball team, you would have to pay taxes on the fair market value of that ring. The same could apply to the equity that you give to your employees.</p><p>You could pay your employee a bonus to cover that tax liability, but the bonus would be taxed. For example, if you grant your employee $100,000 worth of equity and you wanted to cover that employee’s tax bill for getting the equity, you might have to bonus the employee $100,000, so after the employee pays taxes, the net amount is enough to cover the taxes they owe for being given their equity.</p><p>A drawback to this approach is that there could be two layers of taxation: (i) first when you pay the bonus, and (ii) again when the employee pays taxes on the fair market value of their equity. Uncle Sam loves this approach. Our clients? Not so much.</p><h2>3. Sell the Equity to Your Employee for Its Fair Market Value</h2><p>A third option is to sell the equity to your employee for its fair market value. The advantage of this approach is that the employee might not have an immediate taxable event.</p><p>A drawback is that the equity would be less of an incentive, as the employee would have to write a check to your company. “Thank you for the equity that I paid for?”</p>"

Communicate the Plan to Employees</h2><p>Once you determine the allocation formula, you need to communicate the plan to employees.
